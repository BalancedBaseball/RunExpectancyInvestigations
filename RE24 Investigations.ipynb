Teams would keep in mind that all of this data are under the general assumption that teams are trying to score as many runs as possible in most innings. In scenarios where teams are trying to maximize scoring, they would likely choose not to bunt because run expectancy shows that teams score less runs on average when they bunt. In scenarios where teams just need one run to tie or win the game, they might strongly consider the bunt because the probability of scoring increases if the batter can record one out and advance the runners to second and third.\n",
